Customizable sidebar app for Linux in Rust

![SideBar](https://github.com/WaldLumen/SideBar/blob/main/src/assets/screens/main.png "SideBar")

Lil guide:

For everything to work as it should you need to have 2 files in ~/.config/sidebar/ :  
 - settings.ini  
 [settings]  
current-theme=theme name  

 - themes.ini  
[name]  
frame-background = color in rgb( for ex: 255,228,225)  
frame-border-color =   
button-color =   
button-border =   
  
(yeah, now it only needs 4 records)
